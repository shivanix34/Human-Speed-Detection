# Human Speed Detection System using IR Sensors and Arduino Uno

## Introduction
This project introduces an enhanced human speed detection system using IR sensors and an Arduino Uno microcontroller. It accurately measures the speed of individuals in both forward and reverse motion without physical contact, displaying real-time speed readings in kilometers per hour (km/hr) on an LCD display. Accurate speed detection is crucial in sports training, security surveillance, and traffic management. This system addresses the need for precise, non-contact speed measurement using IR technology and Arduino microcontroller capabilities.

## Hardware Used
- **Arduino Uno Microcontroller**: Central processing unit providing computational power and I/O interfaces.
- **Infrared (IR) Sensors**: Positioned 15cm apart to detect individuals and measure time gaps between detections.
- **LCD Display**: Presents speed readings in km/hr for real-time monitoring.

## Conclusion
The human speed detection system presented offers a reliable, non-contact method for measuring speed in various domains. It provides immediate feedback and contributes to performance analysis and safety enhancement. Further improvements can enhance its robustness against environmental factors.
